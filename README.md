Playing around with the Spotify API to familiarise myself with it

## Plan
- [x] Set up basic Flask app with Oauth, listing some of the user's saved songs
- [x] Fetch all saved songs for the user and get genres too
- [ ] Optimise getting genres using one API call instead of calling it for each song - should be a hefty performance improvement
- [ ] Get recent listening history - unfortunately the Spotify API does not allow for querying full listening history for individuals
- [ ] Get all the user's playlists
- [ ] Set up charts on the front end showing song breakdown by genre
